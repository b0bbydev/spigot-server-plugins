# Project Summary
This project is an example of some entry level Java programming using Minecraft. It contains examples of object oriented programming fundamentals such as Instantiation, Inheritance, Abstraction etc.

This was a project done for some self practice along with my interest in video games. Minecraft is a great choice as it allows you to "visualize" your code quite quickly, as you make changes and modify your program. The <a href="https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/spigot/">Spigot API Documenation</a> also makes it very user-friendly for developers to interact with.


## What It Includes
A server ran on your localhost - which can be configured to allow players to connect. <a href="#">see how here</a>

Some examples of how to use the <a href="https://www.spigotmc.org/wiki/spigot/">Spigot API</a> to modify/create features in Minecraft!

Lots of commented code to allow other beginners with similar interests, to try and understand what each line of code is doing. (This is also to help me really understand the Java programming language - and makes the code easier to come back to).

## Server Setup
